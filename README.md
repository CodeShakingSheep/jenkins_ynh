#### Supported architectures

* x86-64b - [![Build Status](https://ci-apps.yunohost.org/jenkins/job/jenkins%20(Community)/badge/icon)](https://ci-apps.yunohost.org/jenkins/job/jenkins%20(Community)/)
* ARMv8-A - [![Build Status](https://ci-apps.yunohost.org/jenkins/job/jenkins%20(Community)%20(%7EARM%7E)/badge/icon)](https://ci-apps.yunohost.org/jenkins/job/jenkins%20(Community)%20(%7EARM%7E)/) Really too slow on ARM architecture. Mostly not recommended to use it on ARM.
